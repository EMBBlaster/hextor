Hextor is a Hexadecimal editor and binary data analyzing toolkit for Windows.

It was created to make working with binary file formats as simple and convenient as with plain text. Although it is staffed with a powerful set of data analyzing tools, it starts instantly and rapidly works with files of any size.

Main features are:

- View data as different basic types (text/hex/int8/16/32/float/etc.)
- Interpret and edit data as [structure with C-like description](https://github.com/digitalw0lf/hextor/wiki/Structure-analyzer)
- View/edit logical volumes, physical disks, process memory
- Unlimited Undo/Redo
- Bookmarks
- Configurable text encoding (ANSI, ASCII etc.)
- Flexible text/hex/unicode search and replace with [wildcards and value search](https://github.com/digitalw0lf/hextor/wiki/Search-and-replace)
- Search and replace in files/directories
- Advanced binary file comparison with insert/delete detection
- View data as bitmap
- "Text editor" mode for huge text files and text sections inside of binary files
- Hash calculation (MD/SHA/CRC etc.)
- Disassembler (using Zydis library)
- Scripting support (via IActiveScript)
- Planned feature: Plugin support (via OleAutomation API)
- Dark and Light UI themes

As with any other low-level tool, use with caution and always make backups of valuable data!

### Building from sources

I recommend using pre-built binaries from Releases page.

If you want to build Hextor yourself:

Hexter is tested with Delphi 10.4.  
Links to all dependencies can be found below in the Credits list. Usually master branch will do.  
AppVersion.Inc is generated by ./Installer/MakeIncludes.sh. I use bash from WSL.  
(or you can just paste `const AppVersion = 'v0.999';` into AppVersion.inc)
